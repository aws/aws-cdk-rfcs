# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Basic Example

If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with CDK to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people how to use CDK
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing CDK applications (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior Art

Discuss priort art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A
few examples of what this could include are.

# Adoption Strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing CDK developers adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? How can we assist in adoption?

# Future Possibilities

THing about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be
and how it would affect CDK as whole. Try to use this section as a tool to more
fully consider all possible interactions with the project and ecosystem in your
proposal. Also consider how this fits into the roadmap for the project.

This is a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you
are writing but are otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply
state that you cannot think of anything.

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
