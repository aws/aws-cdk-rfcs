# Summary

The purpose of this document is to outline the process used to prioritize and mature modules in the AWS-CDK Construct Library. It outlines how we graduate modules from CloudFormation-only resources (L1) to modules that contain high-level resource abstractions (L2) and stabilize them for GA release.

# Motivation

We want to be transparent about the processes the AWS CDK team use, and seek community input to make them better.

# Stages of an AWS-CDK Construct Library Module

The sections below outline the development stages for modules in the AWS-CDK Construct Library and the criteria to graduate the module to the next level of maturity. There are 4 stages of development for an AWS-CDK Construct Library module: 

* Stage 0 - CFN resources (L1) only 
* Stage 1 - Experimental
* Stage 2 - Developer Preview
* Stage 3 - GA 

## Stage 0 - CFN resources (L1) only

All construct library modules start in stage 0 when they are auto-generated from the CloudFormation resource specification. The goal of stage 0 is to make new CloudFormation resources/properties available to CDK customers as soon as possible, and create tracking artifacts that allow us to capture the data required to make prioritization decisions to add L2 resources in the future. 

* **Stage 0 activities:**
    * **Publish package**  - a package for the module is autogenerated and published in the aws-cdk GitHub repo
    * **Publish README** - the module has a rudimentary README doc that: 
        * enables the [Stability:Stable] tag
        * links to the relevant CloudFormation docs
        * includes the basic import statement 
    * **Update API reference** - list the module in the AWS Construct Library API reference
    * **Create GitHub tracking issue** - create a GitHub tracking issue for the module. The primary role of the tracking issue is to: 
        * provide an artifact that represents an entire AWS service that customers can +1 to help us prioritize, and 
        * provide a single artifact to place on the public roadmap to indicate work in progress.
    * **Observe** - watch KPIs (utilization, +1s, and feature requests)
* **Exit Criteria** - AWS-CDK Construct Library modules move to stage 1: 
    * when selected by the CDK team using the [prioritization framework](#Construct-prioritization-framework)
    * OR, when the first community PR for a module is merged

## Stage 1 - Experimental

The goal of the experimental stage is to iterate on the design and functionality of a construct library module with the freedom, and understanding of customers, to make breaking changes when desirable or necessary. During this stage the  primary use cases and the set of L2 constructs required to enable them are incrementally identified, implemented, and validated. 

While experimenting on the module API design and implementation, we will be as transparent as possible with customers about the work in progress. To achieve this we will use the module’s GitHub tracking issue to document use cases and construct design as they are developed in each iteration. Not all communication is required to occur in the tracking issue itself. For large and/or complex changes, we will author a Request for Comments (RFC) that outlines our design and publish it on the roadmap for feedback. We will also use pull requests to conduct construct reviews. In all cases, relevant RFCs, PRs, bugs, and feature requests that are in scope are linked in the module’s tracking issue for visibility. See [Appendix A](#Appendix-A:-GitHub-Artifacts) for an illustration of how these GitHub artifacts are used and related to each other.

* **Stage 1 activities:**

    * **Identify key stakeholders** - Opportunistically recruit stakeholders outside the CDK team to participate in API reviews and usability studies. Potential stakeholders include: service's product manager, service's developer advocates (if any), service's software development engineer (designated by service's leadership), solutions architects who specialize in service (sourced via internal mailing lists), and AWS Developer Tools developer advocates. 
    * **Update GitHub tracking issue** - Summarize the primary use cases and required constructs as they are identified
    * **Author RFCs [optional]** - Request for comment documents are created for large / complex designs that require explanation and robust discussion. RFCs are stored in a separate [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs), and the module's tracking issue will include links to relevant RFCs.
    * **Update Roadmap** - publicly indicate the module is work in progress
        * If an RFC is written, place the module’s tracking issue on the CDK roadmap in the “researching” column to indicate we need customer feedback on the module’s design
        * otherwise, place the module’s tracking issue on the CDK roadmap in the “Working on it“ column
    * **Submit Pull Requests** - pull requests implementing the constructs are submitted, the API design reviewed (by module owner), and merged
    * **Documentation** - update module’s README with explanations and code snippets that illustrate how to use new constructs as they are developed
    * **Publish aws-xyz-experimental package** - deliver experimental constructs in their own package to clearly communicate module maturity. This package is tagged with Stability:Experimental
    * **Observe** - monitor module utilization and GitHub issues filed against the experimental module
        * feature requests and bugs filed against the experimental module are triaged, those that we decide to include in the module are linked in the tracking issue to indicate they are in scope
    * **Repeat** - These activities are repeated until the module owner decides the module is feature complete and the API is ergonomic. At the end of the experimental stage, the construct library module’s GitHub tracking issue will have a description of the service, a list of targeted use cases, and a list of L2 constructs required to satisfy the use cases.
* **Exit Criteria**:
    * **Feature complete** - The module owner declares the module feature complete for targeted use cases, and the API is ergonomic. 
        >**Note**: Feature complete does not mean 100% AWS service feature coverage, instead, it means the module owner thinks we’ve implemented the minimum features required for a delightful developer experience for modeling the service infrastructure as code.
     * **Successful API review** - conduct an API review/developer experience demo and invite relevant stakeholders
        * use module's README as the API review guide
        * address any concerns about API ergonomics
        * review all AWS Lint exceptions to ensure they are acceptable for dev preview
        * ensure at least 90% unit test coverage for all implemented L2 constructs
        * if the API/DevEx is rejected, make a list of necessary remediation tasks and update the module's tracking issue 

## Stage 2 - Developer Preview 

The goal of developer preview is to deliver a release candidate with a stable API to conduct user acceptance testing and accumulate sufficient usage to declare a module is ready for general availability. We will only make breaking changes to developer preview modules when required to address unforeseen customer use cases or issues. Since the potential for breaking changes still remains while in Developer Preview, the package name will keep the “-experimental” suffix during this stage.

* **Stage 2 activities**:
    * **Update Roadmap** - move to the CDK public roadmap “Developer Preview” column to indicate we need customer feedback on the module’s implementation
    * **Observe** - monitor module utilization and GitHub issues filed against the experimental module
    * **Quality Assurance** - fix all P0 bugs as they are  discovered and review all P1 bugs, making a clearly communicated fix/defer decision for each one 
* **Exit Criteria**:
    * **Bake time** - modules will spend at least 3 months in developer preview to accumulate sufficient usage data to gain confidence in the API’s ergonomics and customer acceptance
    * **Usage** - module utilization in 2,000 or more stacks is considered sufficient usage. We will evaluate the language distribution of module use to determine if we need to target specific underrepresented programming language communities for feedback.
    * **No P0 bugs** - no new P0 bugs in the past 4 weeks
    * **Successful API/Docs review** - conduct the final API review/developer experience demo and invite relevant stakeholders
        * review all AWS Lint exceptions and have a high bar for keeping them at GA
        * review and sign-off module’s README by tech writer
        * review and sign-off module's API by module owner
        * if the API/DevEx is rejected, make a list of necessary remediation tasks and update the module's tracking issue

## Stage 3 - GA

The module is generally available with a backwards compatible guarantee across minor versions. 

* **Stage 3 activities**:
    * **Update Roadmap** - move to the CDK roadmap “shipped” column
    * **Remove experimental label** - merge aws-module-experimental constructs into the main aws-module package, and deprecate the experimental package
    * **Communicate availability** - 
        * notifications via Gitter and Twitter
        * comment on the GitHub tracking issue
        * release notes call out new GA modules 
        * write a blog post about how to use the module [optional but highly desired]
    * **Observe** - monitor module utilization and GitHub issues filed against the stable module

# Construct prioritization framework

We use the following tenets to prioritize which AWS-CDK Construct Library modules to work on next:

* _“Don’t experiment on too much at once”_ - no more than 20% of the AWS Construct Library will be experimental at any given time. For reference, on 1/1/2020, the construct library module breakdown = 32% (39/123) Stable, 18% (22/123) Experimental, 50% (62/123) CFN-only.
* _“Focus on what customers ask for”_ - prioritize modules based on number of feature requests and +1’s on GitHub. 
* _“Finish what we’ve started”_ - prioritize modules that already have L2 constructs but are still experimental. 
* _“Do the most difficult work first”_ - prioritize modules that have a large and/or complex API surface area that we know will take significant effort. [Appendix B](#appendix-b:-module-complexity-t-shirt-sizes) proposes “T-shirt” sizes for each module in the construct library to identify work that falls into this category, and module owners are responsible for estimate this effort.
* _“Strategic alignment”_ - prioritize based on AWS / department / team goals. We will use our weekly, monthly, and quarterly planning meetings to identify modules that meet this criteria. For example, in 2019, there was a Developer Tools strategic initiative to enable containerized and serverless application workloads which informed our decisions on what construct library modules to prioritize for CDKs GA launch. 
* _“Focus on what customers are actually using”_ - prioritize constructs that only have CFN resources, but are highly utilized (according to analytics data). A highly used, CFN-only construct library modules might indicate that the low-level resources are sufficient for customer’s primary use cases, and high-level abstractions are not necessary. 

# Appendix A: GitHub artifacts

This diagram illustrates the different GitHub artifacts and their relationships.

* **module tracking issue** - module tracking issues represent an entire AWS service and summarize the planned scope of work for a specific construct library module. This is the issue we want customers to +1 to help us prioritize work on modules that are currently CFN-only, and is the issue we will place on the public roadmap to communicate work in progress.
* **module design RFC [optional]** - Request for comment documents will be created for large / complex designs that require explanation and robust discussion. RFCs are stored in a separate GitHub repo, and the top-level tracking issue should include link to the RFC. 
* **feature requests** - we have a backlog of feature requests tagged for each module. When we decide to include a customer feature request in the scope of work, links to these issues are added to the module’s tracking issue. Customers can +1 and comment on individual feature requests, just like they can +1 and comment on the top-level tracking issue. *Note*: it is not a requirement to address all feature requests when maturing a construct library. 
* **bugs** - similar to feature requests, we have a backlog of P1 and P2 bugs tagged for each module. When we decide to fix specific, known bugs as part of maturing a construct, links to these issues are added to the module’s tracking issue. 
    >**Note**: it is not a requirement to address all P1 or P2 bugs when maturing a construct library.

# Appendix B: Module complexity T-shirt sizes


One of our tenets is to prioritize work on large/complex modules to ensure we make progress on high-level abstractions for services that we cannot complete in a single quarter.Measured in the amount of time required to graduate a module from CFN-only to a Developer Preview release candidate, the proposed sizing scale is:

* **Small**: 1 month or less
* **Medium**: 2-3 months
* **Large**: 3-5 months
* **X-large**: 6 months or more
