# Garbage Collection for Assets

* **Original Author(s):**: @eladb, @kaizen3031593
* **Tracking Issue**: #64
* **API Bar Raiser**: @nlynch

The asset garbage collection CLI will identify and/or delete unused CDK assets,
resulting in smaller bucket/repo size and less cost for customers.

## Working Backwards

**CHANGELOG**:

- feat(cli): `cdk gc` - garbage collection of unused assets

**Help**:

```shell
âžœ cdk gc --help
cdk gc [ENVIRONMENT...]

Finds and deletes all unused S3 and ECR assets in the ENVIRONMENT

Options:
  -l, --list              lists, rather than deletes, all unused assets
  -t, --type=[s3|ecr]     filters for type of asset

Examples:
  cdk gc
  cdk gc aws://ACCOUNT/REGION
  cdk gc --list --type=s3
```

**README:**

The `cdk gc` command reduces the size of your S3 asset bucket and your ecr asset
repository by identifying and deleting unused assets. The command will enter the
specified environment or all environments in the CDK app and determine assets that are no
longer referenced and can be safely deleted. You can also list unused assets using the
`--list` option or filter for a specific type of asset using `--type`.

**Usage:**

This command will garbage collect all unused assets in all environments that belong to the current CDK app (if `cdk.json` exists):

```shell
cdk gc
```

This command will list all unused assets in all environments that belong to the current CDK app:

```shell
cdk gc --list
```

This command will garbage collect unused assets in the specified environment:

```shell
cdk gc aws://ACCOUNT/REGION
```

This command will list unused S3 assets in the specified environment. The options for `--type` are `s3` or `ecr`:

```shell
cdk gc aws://ACOUNT/REGION --type=s3
```

## Public FAQ

> This section should include answers to questions readers will likely ask about

### What are we launching today?

The `cdk gc` command features, with support for garbage collection of unused S3 and ECR
assets.

### Why should I use this feature?

Currently unused assets are left in the S3 bucket or ECR repository and contribute
additional cost for customers. This feature provides a swift way to identify and delete
unutilized assets.

### How does the command identify unused assets?

`cdk gc` will look at all the deployed, healthy stacks in the environment and trace the
assets that are being referenced by these stacks. All assets that are not reached via
tracing can be safely deleted.

## Internal FAQ

> The goal of this section is to help decide if this RFC should be implemented.
> It should include answers to questions that the team is likely ask. Contrary
> to the rest of the RFC, answers should be written "from the present" and
> likely discuss design approach, implementation plans, alternative considered
> and other considerations that will help decide if this RFC should be
> implemented.

### Why are we doing this?

As customers continue to adopt the CDK and grow their CDK applications over time, their
asset buckets/repositories grow as well. At least one customer has
[reported](<https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/64#issuecomment-897548306>) 0.5TB of
assets in their staging bucket. Most of these assets are unused and can be safely removed.

### Why should we _not_ do this?

There is risk of removing assets that are in use, providing additional pain to the
customer. See [this](<https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/64#issuecomment-833758638>)
github comment.

### What is the technical solution (design) of this feature?

> Briefly describe the high-level design approach for implementing this feature.
>
> As appropriate, you can add an appendix with a more detailed design document.
>
> This is a good place to reference a prototype or proof of concept, which is
> highly recommended for most RFCs.

### Is this a breaking change?

No.

### What alternative solutions did you consider?

> Briefly describe alternative approaches that you considered. If there are
> hairy details, include them in an appendix.

### What are the drawbacks of this solution?

> Describe any problems/risks that can be introduced if we implement this RFC.

### What is the high-level project plan?

`cdk gc` will trace all assets referenced by deployed stacks in the environment and delete
the assets that were not reached. As for how to implement this trace, I have not yet
settled on a plan. The command will focus on garbage collecting v2 assets, where there is a
separate S3 bucket and ECR repository in each boostrapped account. Preliminary thoughts are
that we can either search for a string pattern that represents an asset location or utilize
stack metadata that indicates which assets are being used.

### Are there any open issues that need to be addressed later?

> Describe any major open issues that this RFC did not take into account. Once
> the RFC is approved, create GitHub issues for these issues and update this RFC
> of the project board with these issue IDs.

## Appendix

Feel free to add any number of appendices as you see fit. Appendices are
expected to allow readers to dive deeper to certain sections if they like. For
example, you can include an appendix which describes the detailed design of an
algorithm and reference it from the FAQ.
