#### Amazon GameLift Construct Library

[Amazon GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-intro.html) is a service used
to deploy, operate, and scale dedicated, low-cost servers in the cloud for session-based multiplayer games. Built
on AWS global computing infrastructure, GameLift helps deliver high-performance, high-reliability game servers
while dynamically scaling your resource usage to meet worldwide player demand.

GameLift is composed of three main components:

* GameLift FlexMatch which is a customizable matchmaking service for
multiplayer games. With FlexMatch, you can
build a custom set of rules that defines what a multiplayer match looks like
for your game, and determines how to
evaluate and select compatible players for each match. You can also customize
key aspects of the matchmaking
process to fit your game, including fine-tuning the matching algorithm.
  
* GameLift hosting for custom or realtime servers which helps you deploy,
operate, and scale dedicated game servers. It regulates the resources needed to
host games, finds available game servers to host new game sessions, and puts
players into games.
  
* GameLift FleetIQ to optimize the use of low-cost Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) Spot Instances for cloud-based game hosting. With GameLift
FleetIQ, you can work directly with your hosting resources in Amazon EC2 and
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling while taking advantage of GameLift optimizations to
deliver inexpensive, resilient game hosting for your players

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project. It allows you to define components for your matchmaking
configuration or gmae server fleet management system.

#### GameLift FlexMatch

##### Defining a Matchmaking configuration

FlexMatch is available both as a GameLift game hosting solution (including
Realtime Servers) and as a standalone matchmaking service. To set up a
FlexMatch matchmaker to process matchmaking requests, you have to create a
matchmaking configuration based on a RuleSet.

More details about matchmaking ruleSet are covered [below](#ruleset).

There is two types of Matchmaking configuration: through a
game session queue system to let FlexMatch forms matches and
uses the specified GameLift queue to start a game
session for the match, and through a standalone version to let FlexMatch forms
matches and returns match information in an event.

```ts
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

new gamelift.MatchmakingConfiguration(this, 'Standalone Matchmaking', {
  requestTimeouts: Duration.seconds(35)
});
```

More details about Game session queue are covered [below](#game-session-queue).

##### RuleSet

Every FlexMatch matchmaker must have a rule set. The rule set determines the
two key elements of a match: your game's team structure and size, and how to
group players together for the best possible match.

For example, a rule set might describe a match like this: Create a match with
two teams of four to eight players each, one team is the cowboy and the other
team the aliens. A team can have novice and experienced players, but the
average skill of the two teams must be within 10 points of each other. If no
match is made after 30 seconds, gradually relax the skill requirements.

```ts
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

// RuleSet can be definied
// Using either declarative version in the constructor
const skill = {
  name: 'skill',
  type: PlayerAttributeType.STRING,
  default: 10
};

const ruleSet = new gamelift.MatchmakingRuleSet(this, 'Matchmaking RuleSet', {
  playerAttributes: [skill],
  teams: [{
    name: 'aliens',
    minPlayers: 4,
    maxPlayers: 8
  }, {
    name: 'cowboys',
    minPlayers: 4,
    maxPlayers: 8
  }],
  rules: [{
    name: "FairTeamSkill",
    description: "The average skill of players in each team is within 10 points from the average skill of all players in the match",
    type: RuleType.DISTANCE,
    // get skill values for players in each team and average separately to produce list of two numbers
    measurements: [ Query.avg(Teams.all.players[skill]) ],
    // get skill values for players in each team, flatten into a single list, and average to produce an overall average
    referenceValue: Query.avg(Operation.flatten(Teams.all.players[skill])),
    maxDistance: 10 // minDistance would achieve the opposite result
  }, {
    name: "EqualTeamSizes",
    description: "Only launch a game when the number of players in each team matches, e.g. 4v4, 5v5, 6v6, 7v7, 8v8",
    type: RuleType.COMPARISON,
    measurements: [ Query.count(Teams['cowboys'].players) ],
    referenceValue: Query.count(Teams['aliens'].players),
    operation: Operator.EQUAL // other operations: !=, <, <=, >, >=
  }],
  expansions: [{
    target: Rules['FairTeamSkill'].maxDistance,
    steps: [{
        waitTimeSeconds: 30,
        value: 50
    }]
  }]
});

// Either using dedicated methods
const ruleSet = new gamelift.MatchmakingRuleSet(this, 'Matchmaking RuleSet');

ruleSet.addPlayerAttribute('skill', PlayerAttributeType.STRING,10);
ruleSet.addTeam('aliens',4,8);
ruleSet.addTeam('cowboys', 4,8);
ruleSet.addRule({
    name: "FairTeamSkill",
    description: "The average skill of players in each team is within 10 points from the average skill of all players in the match",
    type: RuleType.DISTANCE,
    // get skill values for players in each team and average separately to produce list of two numbers
    measurements: [ [Query.avg(Teams.all.players[skill])] ],
    // get skill values for players in each team, flatten into a single list, and average to produce an overall average
    referenceValue: Query.avg(Operation.flatten(Teams.all.players[skill])),
    maxDistance: 10 // minDistance would achieve the opposite result
});
ruleSet.addRule({
    name: "EqualTeamSizes",
    description: "Only launch a game when the number of players in each team matches, e.g. 4v4, 5v5, 6v6, 7v7, 8v8",
    type: RuleType.COMPARISON,
    measurements: [ Query.count(Teams['cowboys'].players ],
    referenceValue: Query.count(Teams['aliens'].players,
    operation: Operator.EQUAL // other operations: !=, <, <=, >, >=
});
ruleSet.addExpansion({
    target: Rules['FairTeamSkill'].maxDistance,
    steps: [{
        waitTimeSeconds: 30,
        value: 50
    }]
});

new gamelift.MatchmakingConfiguration(this, 'Standalone Matchmaking', {
  requestTimeouts: Duration.seconds(35),
  ruleSet: ruleSet
});

```

Or either using low level integration methods to inject a JSON file or string directly

```ts
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const matchmaking = new MatchmakingConfiguration(this, 'Standalone Matchmaking', {
  requestTimeouts: Duration.seconds(35),
  ruleSet: MatchmakingRuleSet.fromJsonFile(path.join(__dirname, 'rules.json'))
});

const matchmaking = new MatchmakingConfiguration(this, 'Standalone Matchmaking', {
  requestTimeouts: Duration.seconds(35),
  ruleSet: MatchmakingRuleSet.fromJsonContent(MY_JSON_STRING_CONTENT)
});
```

##### Monitoring

You can monitor GameLift FlexMatch activity for matchmaking configurations and
matchmaking rules using Amazon CloudWatch. These statistics are used to provide
a historical perspective on how your Gamelift FlexMatch solution is performing.

###### Metrics

GameLift FlexMatch sends metrics to CloudWatch so that you can collect and
analyze the activity of your matchmaking solution, including match acceptance
workflow, ticket consumtion.

You can then use CloudWatch alarms to alert you, for example, when matches has
been rejected (potential matches that were rejected by at least one player
since the last report) exceed a certain thresold which could means that you may
have an issue in your matchmaking rules.

CDK provides methods for accessing GameLift metrics with default configuration,
such as `metricCurrentTickets`, or `metricMatchAccepted` (see
[`IMatchmakingConfiguration`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-gamelift.IMatchmakingConfiguration.html)
for a full list). CDK also provides a generic `metric` method that can be used
to produce metric configurations for any metric provided by GameLift FlexMatch;
the configurations are pre-populated with the correct dimensions for the
matchmaking configuration.

```ts fixture=with-matchmaking-configuration
import * as cloudwatch from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch';
// Alarm that triggers when the per-second average of not placed matches exceed 10%
const matchesPlacedRatio = new cloudwatch.MathExpression({
  expression: '1 - (matchesPlaced / matchedCreated)',
  usingMetrics: {
    matchesPlaced: matchmakingConfiguration.metricMatchesPlaced({ statistic: cloudwatch.Statistic.SUM }),
    matchesCreated: matchmakingConfiguration.metric('MatchesCreated'),
  },
});
new Alarm(this, 'Alarm', {
  metric: matchesPlacedRatio,
  threshold: 0.1,
  evaluationPeriods: 3,
});
```

See: [Monitoring Using CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

#### GameLift Hosting

##### Defining a GameLift Fleet

GameLift helps you deploy, operate, and scale dedicated game servers for
session-based multiplayer games. It helps you regulate the resources needed to
host your games, finds available game servers to host new game sessions, and
puts players into games.

###### Creating a realtime game server fleet

This lightweight server solution provides ready-to-go game servers that you can
configure to fit your game. To set up and optionnally customize a realtime
server fleet, you need to provide a script (in the form of some JavaScript
code).

```ts
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-assets';
import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

// Script can be declared using either declarative version in the constructor
const script = new gamelift.Script(this, 'Realtime script', {
  location: new s3.Asset(this, "SampleScriptAsset", {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'file-asset.js')
  })
});

// Either using dedicated factory static method
const script = gamelift.fromScriptAsset(path.join(__dirname, 'file-asset.js');

new gamelift.ScriptFleet(this, 'Realtime server fleet', {
  content: script
});
```

###### Creating a custom game server fleet

Your uploaded game servers are hosted on GameLift virtual computing resources,
called instances. You set up your hosting resources by creating a fleet of
instances and deploying them to run your game servers. You can design a fleet
to fit your game's needs.

```ts
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-assets';
import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

// Build can be declared using either declarative version in the constructor
const build = new gamelift.Build(this, 'Game server build', {
  location: new s3.Asset(this, "SampleZippedDirAsset", {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "sample-asset-directory")
  })
});

// Either using dedicated factory static method
const build = gamelift.fromBuildAsset(path.join(__dirname, 'CustomerGameServer/');

new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});
```

##### Managing game servers launch configuration

GameLift uses a fleet's runtime configuration to determine the type and number
of processes to run on each instance in the fleet. At a minimum, a runtime
configuration contains one server process configuration that represents one
game server executable. You can also define additional server process
configurations to run other types of processes related to your game. Each
server process configuration contains the following information:

* The file name and path of an executable in your game build.

* Optionally Parameters to pass to the process on launch.

* The number of processes to run concurrently.

A GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running concurrently.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

// Server processes can be delcared in a declarative way through the constructor
const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build,
  gameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds: 123,
  maxConcurrentGameSessionActivations: 123,
  serverProcesses: [{
    launchPath: '/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64',
    parameters: '-logFile /local/game/logs/myserver1935.log -port 1935',
    concurrentExecutions: 100,
  }]
});

// Or through dedicated runtimeConfiguration methods
fleet.addServerProcess({
  launchPath: '/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64',
  parameters: '-logFile /local/game/logs/myserver1935.log -port 1935',
  concurrentExecutions: 100,
});
```

See [Managing how game servers are launched for hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-multiprocess.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

##### Defining an instance type

GameLift uses Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) resources, called
instances, to deploy your game servers and host game sessions for your players.
When setting up a new fleet, you decide what type of instances your game needs
and how to run game server processes on them (using a runtime configuration). All instances in a fleet use the same type of resources and the same runtime
configuration. You can edit a fleet's runtime configuration and other fleet
properties, but the type of resources cannot be changed.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';

new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build,
  instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
});
```

##### Using Spot instances

When setting up your hosting resources, you have the option of using Spot
Instances, On-Demand Instances, or a combination.

By default, this property is set to ON_DEMAND.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build,
  type: FleetType.SPOT
});
```

##### Allowing Ingress traffic

The allowed IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to
access game sessions on this fleet.

New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which
must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges. Fleets with custom game builds must
have permissions explicitly set. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift
automatically opens two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';

const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build,
});
// Allowing all IP Addresses from port 1111 to port 1122 on TCP Protocol
fleet.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.anyIpv4(), ec2.Port.tcp(1111), ec2.Port.tcp(1122));

// Allowing a specific CIDR for port 1111 on UDP Protocol
fleet.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.ipv4('1.2.3.4/32'), ec2.Port.udp(1111));
```

##### Managing locations

A single Amazon GameLift fleet has a home Region by default (the Region you
deploy it to), but it can deploy resources to any number of GameLift supported
Regions. Select Regions based on where your players are located and your
latency needs.

By default Stack region is used.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});
```

but we can add new locations if needed and define desired capacity

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

// Through constructor properties
const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build,
  locations: [ {
    name: 'eu-west-1',
    desiredCapacity: 5,
    minCapacity: 2,
    maxCapacity: 10
  }, {
    name: 'us-east-1',
    desiredCapacity: 5,
    minCapacity: 2,
    maxCapacity: 10
  }
});

// Or through dedicated methods
const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});
fleet.addLocation('eu-west-1', 5, 2, 10);
fleet.addLocation('us-east-1', 5, 2, 10);
```

##### Monitoring

GameLift is integrated with CloudWatch, so you can monitor the performance of
your game servers via logs and metrics.

###### Metrics

GameLift Fleet sends metrics to CloudWatch so that you can collect and analyze
the activity of your Fleet, including game  and player sessions and server
processes.

You can then use CloudWatch alarms to alert you, for example, when matches has
been rejected (potential matches that were rejected by at least one player
since the last report) exceed a certain thresold which could means that you may
have an issue in your matchmaking rules.

CDK provides methods for accessing GameLift Fleet metrics with default configuration,
such as `metricActiveInstances`, or `metricIdleInstances` (see [`IFleet`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-gamelift.IFleet.html)
for a full list). CDK also provides a generic `metric` method that can be used
to produce metric configurations for any metric provided by GameLift Fleet,
Game sessions or server processes; the configurations are pre-populated with
the correct dimensions for the matchmaking configuration.

```ts fixture=with-matchmaking-configuration
import * as cloudwatch from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch';
// Alarm that triggers when the per-second average of not used instances exceed 10%
const instancesUsedRatio = new cloudwatch.MathExpression({
  expression: '1 - (activeInstances / idleInstances)',
  usingMetrics: {
    activeInstances: fleet.metricActiveInstances({ statistic: cloudwatch.Statistic.SUM }),
    idleInstances: fleet.metric('IdleInstances'),
  },
});
new Alarm(this, 'Alarm', {
  metric: instancesUsedRatio,
  threshold: 0.1,
  evaluationPeriods: 3,
});
```

See: [Monitoring Using CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

##### Specifying an IAM role

Some GameLift features require you to extend limited access to your AWS
resources. This is done by creating an AWS IAM role. The GameLift Fleet class
automatically created an IAM role with all the minimum necessary permissions
for GameLift to access your ressources. If you wish, you may
specify your own IAM role.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const role = new iam.Role(this, 'Role', {
  assumedBy: new iam.CompositePrincipale(new iam.ServicePrincipal('gamelift.amazonaws.com'),
  new iam.ServicePrincipal('ec2.amazonaws.com'))
});
role.addManagedPolicy(ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy'));

new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  build = build,
  role: role
});

```

If you need to access resources in your own account and you have a multi-region
fleet with locations in one of the opt-in regions, add gamelift.opt-in-region.amazonaws.com
to the role trust policy. The following example includes the four
supported opt-in regions:

* gamelift.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com
* gamelift.me-south-1.amazonaws.com
* gamelift.af-south-1.amazonaws.com
* gamelift.eu-south-1.amazonaws.com

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const role = new iam.Role(this, 'Role', {
  assumedBy: new iam.ServicePrincipal('gamelift.amazonaws.com')
});
role.addServicePrincipal('gamelift.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com');
role.addServicePrincipal('gamelift.me-south-1.amazonaws.com');
role.addServicePrincipal('gamelift.af-south-1.amazonaws.com');
role.addServicePrincipal('gamelift.eu-south-1.amazonaws.com');

new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content = build,
  role: role
});

```

##### Alias

A GameLift alias is used to abstract a fleet designation. Fleet designations
tell Amazon GameLift where to search for available resources when creating new
game sessions for players. By using aliases instead of specific fleet IDs, you
can more easily and seamlessly switch player traffic from one fleet to another
by changing the alias's target location.

```ts

import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

// Either using a dedicated constructor
const alias = new gamelift.Alias(this, 'Fleet alias', {
  name: 'live',
  routingStrategy: RoutingStrategyType.SIMPLE,
  fleet: fleet
});

// Or through dedicated fleet methods
const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});
const liveAlias = fleet.addAlias('live');
```

See [Add an alias to a GameLift fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/aliases-creating.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

#### Game session queue

The game session queue is the primary mechanism for processing new game session
requests and locating available game servers to host them. Although it is
possible to request a new game session be hosted on specific fleet or location.

The `GameSessionQueue` resource creates a placement queue that processes requests for
new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement
locations and find an available game server, then prompts the game server to start a
new game session. Queues can have destinations (GameLift fleets or aliases), which
determine where the queue can place new game sessions. A queue can have destinations
with varied fleet type (Spot and On-Demand), instance type, and AWS Region.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build,
});

//Bind a queue to a Fleet either directly into constructor
const queue = new gamelift.GameSessionQueue(this, 'Game session queue', {
  destinations: [fleet]
});

// Or through dedicated methods
const queue = new gamelift.GameSessionQueue(this, 'Game session queue');
queue.addDestination(fleet);
```

See [Setting up GameLift queues for game session placement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/realtime-script-uploading.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

##### Integrating with a Matchmaking solution

FlexMatch is available with the managed GameLift hosting for custom game
servers and Realtime Servers. To add FlexMatch matchmaking to your game, you
have to bind both components through a game session queue.

```ts fix
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});

// Bind fllet to a queue either using constructor
const queue = new gamelift.GameSessionQueue(this, 'Game Session Queue', {
  placementTimeout: Duration.seconds(10),
  destinations: [fleet]
});

// Bind a queue to a matchmaking configuration either using constructor
const matchmaking = new gamelift.MatchmakingConfiguration(this, 'Standalone Matchmaking', {
  requestTimeouts: Duration.seconds(35),
  ruleSet: MatchmakingRuleSet.fromJsonFile(path.join(__dirname, 'rules.json')),
  queue: queue
});

// Or through dedicated methods
const matchmaking = new gamelift.MatchmakingConfiguration(this, 'Standalone Matchmaking', {
  requestTimeouts: Duration.seconds(35),
  ruleSet: MatchmakingRuleSet.fromJsonFile(path.join(__dirname, 'rules.json'))
});
matchmaking.withQueue(queue);
```

See: [FlexMatch integration with GameLift hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-tasks.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FlexMatch Developer Guide*.

##### Priority configuration

Custom prioritization settings for use by a game session queue
when placing new game sessions with available game servers. When
defined, this configuration replaces the default FleetIQ
prioritization process, which is as follows:

If player latency data is included in a game session request,
destinations and locations are prioritized first based on lowest
average *latency* (1), then on *lowest hosting cost* (2), then on
*destination list order* (3), and finally on *location
(alphabetical)* (4). This approach ensures that the queue's top
priority is to place game sessions where average player latency
is lowest, and--if latency is the same--where the hosting cost
is less, etc.

If player latency data is not included, *destinations and locations* are prioritized
first on destination list order (1), and then on *location (alphabetical)* (2). This
approach ensures that the queue's top priority is to place game sessions on the first
destination fleet listed. If that fleet has multiple locations, the game session is
placed on the first location (when listed alphabetically).

Changing the priority order will affect how game sessions are placed.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});

const queue = new gamelift.GameSessionQueue(this, 'Game session queue', {
  placementTimeout: Duration.seconds(10),
  destinations: [fleet],
  priorityConfiguration: {
    locationOrder: ['eu-west-1', 'us-east-1'],
    priorityOrder: [
      PriorityOrder.COST,
      PriorityOrder.LATENCY,
      PriorityOrder.LOCATION,
      PriorityOrder.DESTINATION
    ]
  }
});
```

##### Player latency policy

The queue setting that determines the highest latency allowed
for individual players when placing a game session. When a
latency policy is in force, a game session cannot be placed with
any fleet in a Region where a player reports latency higher than
the cap. Latency policies are only enforced when the placement
request contains player latency information.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});

// Using either declarative in constructor
const queue = new gamelift.GameSessionQueue(this, 'Game session queue', {
  placementTimeout: Duration.seconds(10),
  destinations: [fleet],
  playerLatencyPolicies: [{
    maximumIndividualPlayerLatency: Duration.milliseconds(1000),
    policyDuration: Duration.seconds(60)
  }]
});

// Or dedicated methods
const queue = new gamelift.GameSessionQueue(this, 'Game session queue', {
  placementTimeout: Duration.seconds(10),
  destinations: [fleet]
});
queue.addPlayerLatencyPolicy(Duration.milliseconds(1000), Duration.seconds(60));
```

##### Filter configuration

A list of fleet locations where a game session queue can place
new game sessions. You can use a filter to temporarily turn off
placements for specific locations. For queues that have
multi-location fleets, you can use a filter configuration allow
placement with some, but not all of these locations.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});

const queue = new gamelift.GameSessionQueue(this, 'Game session queue', {
  placementTimeout: Duration.seconds(10),
  destinations: [fleet],
  filterConfiguration: {
    allowedLocations: ['eu-west-1', 'us-east-1']
  }
});
```

###### Setting notifications

If you're using queues to manage game session placement in your game, you need
a way to monitor the status of individual placement requests and take action as
appropriate. Implementing event notifications is a fast and efficient method
for tracking placement activity. If your game is in production, or in
pre-production with high-volume placement activity, you should be using event
notifications.

There are two options for setting up event notifications. You can set up an SNS
topic and have GameLift publish event notifications on placement activity by
referencing the topic ID in a game session queue. Alternatively, you can use
Amazon CloudWatch Events, which has a suite of tools available for managing
events and taking action on them.

```ts fixture=with-build
import * as gamelift from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const fleet = new gamelift.BuildFleet(this, 'Game server fleet', {
  content: build
});

#### GameLift FleetIQ

The GameLift FleetIQ solution is a game hosting layer that supplements the full
set of computing resource management tools that you get with Amazon EC2 and
Auto Scaling. This solution lets you directly manage your Amazon EC2 and Auto
Scaling resources and integrate as needed with other AWS services.

##### Defining a Game Server Group

When using GameLift FleetIQ, you prepare to launch Amazon EC2 instances as
usual: make an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with your game server software,
create an Amazon EC2 launch template, and define configuration settings for an
Auto Scaling group. However, instead of creating an Auto Scaling group
directly, you create a GameLift FleetIQ game server group with your Amazon EC2
and Auto Scaling resources and configuration. All game server groups must have
at least two instance types defined for it.

Once a game server group and Auto Scaling group are up and running with
instances deployed, when updating a Game Server Group instance, only certain
properties in the Auto Scaling group may be overwrite. For all other Auto
Scaling group properties, such as MinSize, MaxSize, and LaunchTemplate, you can
modify these directly on the Auto Scaling group using the AWS Console or
dedicated Api.

```ts
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const template = new ec2.LaunchTemplate(this, 'LaunchTemplate', {
  machineImage: ec2.MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux(),
  securityGroup: new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'LaunchTemplateSG', {
    vpc: vpc,
  }),
});

new gamelift.GameServerGroup(this, 'Game server group', {
  instanceDefinition = [{
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
      weightedCapacity: 16

  }, {
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.MEDIUM),
      weightedCapacity: 24
  }],
  launchTemplate = template,
});
```

See [Manage game server groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-integrate-gameservergroup.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

##### Scaling Policy

The scaling policy uses the metric `PercentUtilizedGameServers` to maintain a
buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and
players.

```ts fixture=with-launch-template
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const template = new ec2.LaunchTemplate(this, 'LaunchTemplate', {
  machineImage: ec2.MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux(),
  securityGroup: new ec2.SecurityGroup(this, 'LaunchTemplateSG', {
    vpc: vpc,
  }),
});

new gamelift.GameServerGroup(this, 'Game server group', {
  instanceDefinition = [{
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
  }],
  launchTemplate = template,
  scalingPolicy: {
    utilizedGameServersPercent: 66
  }
});

```

See [Manage game server groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-integrate-gameservergroup.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

##### Specifying an IAM role

The GameLift FleetIQ class automatically creates an IAM role with all the minimum necessary
permissions for GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. If you wish, you may
specify your own IAM role. It must have the correct permissions, or FleetIQ creation or ressource usage may fail.

```ts fixture=with-launch-template
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const role = new iam.Role(this, 'Role', {
  assumedBy: new iam.CompositePrincipale(new iam.ServicePrincipal('gamelift.amazonaws.com'),
  new iam.ServicePrincipal('autoscaling.amazonaws.com'))
});
role.addManagedPolicy(ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName('GameLiftGameServerGroupPolicy'));

new gamelift.GameServerGroup(this, 'Game server group', {
  instanceDefinition = [{
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
  }],
  launchTemplate = template,
  instanceRole: role
});
```

See [Controlling Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

##### Specifying VPC Subnets

GameLift FleetIQ use by default, all supported GameLift FleetIQ Availability
Zones in your chosen region. You can override this parameter to specify VPCs
subnets that you've set up.

This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the
corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set
with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.

```ts fixture=with-rule-set
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2';
import * as gamelift from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift';

const vpc = new ec2.Vpc(this, 'TheVPC', {
   cidr: "10.0.0.0/16"
});

const fleet = new gamelift.GameServerGroup(this, 'FleetIQ fleet', {
  instanceDefinition = [{
      instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
  }],
  launchTemplate = template,
  subnets: vpc.selectSubnets({
    subnetType: ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_NAT
  })
});
```

##### Monitoring

GameLift FleetIQ sends metrics to CloudWatch so that you can collect and
analyze the activity of your Game server fleet, including the number of
utilized game servers, and the number of game server interruption due to
limited Spot availability.

You can then use CloudWatch alarms to alert you, for example, when the portion
of game servers that are currently supporting game executions exceed a certain
thresold which could means that your autoscaling policy need to be adjust to
add more instances to match with player demand.

CDK provides methods for accessing GameLift metrics with default configuration,
such as `metricGameServerInterruptions`, or `metricAvailableGameServers` (see
[`IFleetIQ`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-gamelift.IMatchmakingConfiguration.html)
for a full list). CDK also provides a generic `metric` method that can be used
to produce metric configurations for any metric provided by GameLift FleetIQ;
the configurations are pre-populated with the correct dimensions for the
matchmaking configuration.

```ts fixture=with-matchmaking-configuration
import * as cloudwatch from '@aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudwatch';
// Alarm that triggers when the percent of utilized game servers exceed 90%
new Alarm(this, 'Alarm', {
  metric: fleet.metricPercentUtilizedGameServers,
  threshold: 0.9,
  evaluationPeriods: 2,
});
```

See: [Monitoring with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-metrics.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

## Public FAQ

### What are we launching today?

We are launching a new module (`@aws-cdk-lib/aws-gamelift`) that contains
multiple L2
construct to help consumers to manager their Fleet or Matchmaking rules. This
launch fully and fluently supports Amazon Gamelift (a fully-managed service for
hosting game servers) within the CDK.

### Why should I use this feature?

Specify and spin up a gamer server hosting solution that deploys, operates and
scales cloud servers for multiplayer games. Possibles use-cases include
defining and deploying a 2vs2 multiplayer solution based on player Skills. Using
GameLift with CDK smooths many configuration edges and provides seamless
integrations with your existing infrastructure as code.

## Internal FAQ

### Why are we doing this?

Create, operate, scale and deploy cloud servers for multiplayer games requires
a fairly verbose configuration to set up depending on the desired
matchmaking ruleset and Fleet configuration needed. For example, a fleet system
binded to a matchmaking configuration synthesizes to about 400 lines
of JSON/YAML from about 15 lines of Typescript code.The Fleet requires only few
variables to be configured and a single method call to create and attach a
matchmaking configuration. While we retain flexibility, we simplify the
understanding of different components binding by replacing this comlplexity by
a high level method / pattern approch.

Using Amazon GameLift without the CDK requires network configuration,
instance sizing, complex
permission statements and notification system, and manual intervention. We have
added 10+ compile-time validations
and auto-generated permissions to ensure matchmaking configuraton, queues and
Fleet are correctly integrated, avoiding
days of debugging errors. We have leveraged custom resources in order to
perform a one-click deployment that creates an immediately functional
application with no manual
effort.

### Why should we *not* do this?

We are not confident that the service API is fully set in stone and
implementing an L2 on top of the current L1 may be setting us up for changes in
the future. We are reaching out to the service team to get their input and
plans for the service to be sure we already plan new design impoact on our L2
construct design. Second topic will to update all technical contents already
released to fit our new L2 implementation design.

It’s a large effort to invest in a module when we have other pressing projects.
However, the design of the effort has been spent already since we have fairly
robust prototypes already implemented.

### Is this a breaking change?

No.

### What alternative solutions did you consider?

* Merging `GameServerGroup` and `Fleet` to one single system to simplify
design as in a high level point of viesw we are creating a game server Fleet.

* Exporting high level Matchmaking ruleSet constructs like `withTwoTeamBasedOnSkillRules` to an external and dedicated package `aws-gamelift-ruleset-patterns`.

### What are the drawbacks of this solution?

No problems or risks of implementing this feature as a whole, though the
design outlined
above may have drawbacks, as detailed below in "alternative solutions".

### What is the high-level project plan?

> Describe your plan on how to deliver this feature from prototyping to GA.
> Especially think about how to "bake" it in the open and get constant feedback
> from users before you stabilize the APIs.
>
> If you have a project board with your implementation plan, this is a good
> place to link to it.

### Are there any open issues that need to be addressed later?

No specific issues identified for now.
