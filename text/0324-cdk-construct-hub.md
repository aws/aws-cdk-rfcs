# Construct Hub

A community-driven hub for discovering and sharing construct libraries.

## Working Backwards

### PRESS RELEASE

Today, Amazon Web Services Inc., an Amazon company, announced the Construct Hub,
a website that makes it easy to find constructs (including AWS CDK,
CDK8s, CDKtf, Projen, ...) libraries and provides a centralized documentation
experience for those. Construct Hub automatically indexes custom construct
libraries as soon as they are published, without requiring any additional effort
from the author. The AWS CDK makes it easy for customers to build applications
by raising the level of abstraction of infrastructure components, and Construct
Hub makes it easy to discover, use and share custom-made constructs. To get
started with Construct Hub, visit `https://constructs.dev`.

Construct Hub offers an integrated search experience, allowing customers to
easily find the right construct for their need. The built-in multi-language
documentation helps customers understand what features are available, and learn
how to correctly use the constructs in their chosen programming language.

The Construct Hub itself is developed as an open-source construct: members
of constructs community can freely participate in the development of the
service. Customers with specific needs are also able to deploy a private
instance of the Construct Hub, and integrate it with their package management
solution.

## FAQ

### What are we launching today?

Construct Hub is a new website that makes it easy for developers to discover,
use, and share constructs. The community has already published hundreds of CDK,
CDK8s, CDKtf, projen, ... constructs on the public registries like npmjs.com,
PyPI, Maven Central, and NuGet. However those are distributed repositories,
managed by numerous organizations, and lack centralized search tools sufficient
for developers to easily find the cloud infrastructure patterns they are looking
for, in the programming language they want to use.

Construct Hub automatically indexes all construct libraries published to the
various general purpose package managers, so that developers have a single place
to search for constructs, regardless of preferred programming language or
provisioning engine. Developers will find constructs published by AWS, partners,
and individual developers. Constuct Hub also generates unified documentation for
the constructs in all supported programming languages.

Construct Hub is also available as a deployable CDK construct library, so
that enterprises and users with specific needs can host a private instance of
the catalog, making interally developed constructs easier for teams to find.
Just like the public instance of Construct Hub scans public repositories for
construct libraries, the private Construct Hub instance can be configured to
scan private repositories like AWS CodeArtifact, JFrog Artifactory, and others.

### Why should I use this feature?

The Construct Hub is a centralized place that helps discover and share
custom-made constructs compatible with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), CDK
for Kubernetes (CDK8s), CDK for Terraform (CDKtf), and other constructs domains
such as Projen. It shortens the time it takes to ship cloud applications by
allowing developers to discover constructs that address their infrastructure
requirements, and provides a unified cross-language documentation experience to
help developers integrate those constructs into their application.

Customers can also deploy a private instance of Construct Hub to facilitate
sharing infrastructure abstractions published to a private package registry
within the organization.

### Where can I find the Construct Hub?

The public instance of Construct Hub is at: `https://constructs.dev`.

### How do I publish a package to Construct Hub?

Packages published to the public npm registry (npmjs.com) are automatically
indexed by the public instance of Construct Hub as long as they meet the
following prerequisites:

1. Cross-language support has been configured correctly using [jsii]
1. The `cdk` keyword is referenced (in the `keywords` key of `package.json`)

[jsii]: https://aws.github.io/jsii

### Can I opt packages out of the public instance of Construct Hub?

There is currently no self-service way to un-list a package from the Construct
Hub. If you would like your package to be removed from the public instance of
Construct Hub, please file an issue in GitHub. You will be required to prove
ownership of the package(s) you are requesting un-listing for.

### Can I trust all constructs listed on Construct Hub?

Construct Hub does not perform a comprehensive audit of packages it indexes.
You should not trust packages found via the Construct Hub any differently
from packages found via other package search tools or registries, such as
npmjs.com, Maven Central, PyPI, NuGet, etc.

## Specification

### Landing Page

> [Example rendering](#rendering-landing-page)

The landing page for the Construct Hub includes a search bar that allows
developers to search for constructs that solve their use-case using relevant
keywords, and optionally filtering on a specific programming language and
constructs domain (AWS CDK / CDK8s / CDKtf / Projen / ...).

It may also feature a short-list of packages, selected based on popularity or
latest release date. The format of that list is the same as the format of search
results.

### Search Results Page

When a search is performed using the search bar in the landing page (or in the
header of all other pages), a list of relevant results is displayed as tiles,
similar to the short-list of packages shown on the landing page.

The results grid includes the following elements about returned packages:

- Name
- Short description (truncated to fit if needed)
- Author name
- Publish date
- Latest version

In the future, it may also include quality or popularity indications such as
the number of downloads of that package.

### Package Detail Page

> [Example rendering](#rendering-package-detail-page)

Clicking on a given package's tile in the landing page or search result page
brings the user to a package detail page that represents the following
information:

- Package name, tags, and description
- Overview of publishing information (author, version, license, etc...)
  - Where possible, links to the source repository, issue tracker, etc... based
    on information registered in the `.jsii` assembly file.
- Install instructions
- Available languages
- Package's documentation
  - Rendered content of the package's `README.md`
  - API reference documentation, in all supported languages (only the version
    for the currently selected language is displayed)

The list of available languages is also a selector: upon clicking a language,
the installation instructions and documentation automatically switch to the
relevant form for the currently selected language.

### Support

The Construct Hub offers ways for customers to engage maintainers about
various problems, including the following (actually routed to GitHub issue
templates):

- A malicious package was identified
- Incorrectly rendered documentation
- Package un-listing request
- Offensive content

When a contact request originates from a package detail page, the customer is
guided to the package's issue tracker or public repository if their issue is
with the package itself (and not about it's listing in Construct Hub). The
routing is based on metadata configured on the package itself, through the bug
tracker URL, repository URL, and homepage URL.

## Technical Design

### Design Tenets

- The initial version of Construct Hub is a static website
  - It is served entirely by CloudFront
  - All content served is strictly read-only
- Search happens client-side, based off a single catalog object
- Analytics will be handled by a third-party solution

### Overview

![Architecture Diagram](../images/cdk-construct-hub/architecture-diagram.png)

### What is the high level implementation plan?

#### Overview

The Construct Hub is a relatively simple static web application. While the
dataset it exposes (all construct libraries) may be relatively fast moving,
there is no necessity for newly published packages (or versions thereof) to be
indexed and presented on the application particularly quickly. A consistency
window between a couple of hours and a day is probably acceptable. The Construct
Hub however strives to maintain a 10 minutes SLA between the moment a new
package is published in a monitored registry and the moment it's information is
ready to browse on the website.

A simple data pipeline will ingest package publication events created by a
source-specific adapter (e.g: by polling on the CouchDB instance replica for the
[npmjs.com registry](https://skimdb.npmjs.com/registry)), and produce static
artifacts the website is based off of. This pipeline is in particular
responsible for extracting the `.jsii` assembly file from the npm packages, and
to prefetch all information necessary to back the website's search and package
detail pages.

#### Back-End

1. **Package Discovery:** The back-end for Construct Hub starts with a custom
   built event source, which implements the logic necessary to detect new
   packages that are relevant to the Construct Hub (packages that contain a
   `.jsii` assembly files and have a dependency on the `constructs` package),
   determines additional metadata to be recorded with the package-version (such
   as the constructs domain it targets), then sends messages to an SQS queue for
   further processing. Notifications have the following attributes:

   Name          | Description
   --------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
   `tarballUri`  | The URL to an S3 Object containing the npm package's `.tgz` bundle
   `metadata`    | Metadata assigned by the discovery function to the package (key-value pairs)
   `time`        | The timestamp at which the version was created
   `integrity`   | An integirity check for the complete record

   The Construct Hub will have permissions to read from (and, if applicable, to
   decrypt) the S3 bucket that is used to hold the object denoted by
   `tarballUri`. That bucket may have a Lifecycle configuration that cleans up
   objects after a few days, as objects need not be retained there after they
   have been successfully ingested by the Construct Hub (which will own and
   maintain a copy of this artifact).

   Construct Hub comes with a built-in integration function that listens to
   changes on the [npmjs.com registry](https://skimdb.npmjs.com/registry)
   database. Operators of private instances are able to interface with other
   package registries (including private ones), such as CodeArtifact
   repositories, etc.

1. **Ingestion:** A Lambda function then picks up messages from the SQS queue
   and prepares the artifacts consumed by the front-end application, stored in a
   dedicated S3 bucket using the following key format:
   - Package tarball: `packages/${assembly.name}/v${assembly.version}/package.tgz`
   - `.jsii` assembly: `packages/${assembly.name}/v${assembly.version}/assembly.json`

   This function validates the contents of the `.jsii` assembly file found in the
   `package.tgz` bundle to ensure the message was well-formed. In case the message
   is found to be incoherent, it is sent to a dead-letter queue and an alarm is triggered.

   - Optionally (this information may not be necessary, in particular for the
     minimal viable product), it also creates or updates the
     `packages/${assembly.name}/versions.json` object, which contains a list of
     all versions ever indexed for the package, matched to the versions' current
     status (`deprecated`, `latest`, ...):

     Name        | Description
     ------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
     `v${major}` | All versions part of this major version stream, and their status

     In order to ensure consistency of the contents of the `versions.json`
     object, its content will always be generated from the live inventory of
     objects in S3 (and not incrementally using the update trigger event), and
     the last event timestamp will be written in an object metadata attribute.
     The S3 Bucket will have object versioning enabled, and once a new version
     of the `versions.json` object has been created, its metadata will be
     checked against any previous versions of the object, and the "current"
     version will be set to the one with the latest event timestamp if needed.

   The operator of private instances can provide an optional SNS topic which
   will be notified once the information for a new package version is ready to
   be browsed.

1. **Doc-Gen:** A series of Lambda functions prepare language-specific documentation definition
   files for each configured language, with adjusted naming conventions, and
   updated sample code fragments, and proceeds to store those at:
   `packages/${assembly.name}/v${assembly.version}/docs-${lang}.json`.
   This transformation is backed by the `jsii-rosetta` tool, which is part of
   the [jsii project][jsii], as well as custom code for generating language specific API references.

   - The **Doc-Gen** functions run asynchronously, and the documentation definition
     eventually becomes available. If the object is not available yet,
     the web UI should present the user with a message inviting them to come
     again later (in an hour or two, etc...).

   - The overall time to process each language is monitored, and in case a
     specific package-language pair consistently fails processing, it is
     notified to a dead-letter queue for engineer investigation.

   - Optionally, tools may be made available to allow livrary developers to
     pre-compute transliterated assemblies for their libraries, so that these
     are immediately available as they packages are indexed.

   To ensure compatiblity between the schema of the definition, and the consuming
   code (i.e the front-end application), the stored file will contain its version in the `version` field of the schema.

   > For more information on this, see the [Backend X Frontend Compatiblity](#backend-x-frontend-compatibility) section.

1. **Catalog Builder:** A Lambda function keeps the `catalog.json` object
   updated with the latest versions of each package's major version lines, which
   backs the websites' search page. The object may be sharded if it becomes too
   large. S3 Object Versioning will be used to ensure concurrent updates to the
   content result in a consistent end state, by listing object versions before
   and after updating the `catalog.json` object and performing the necessary
   corrections if needed.

The data stored in the S3 bucket is going to be served by a CloudFront
distribution using the following URLs:

URL                                                    | Description
-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------
`<root>/catalog[.json]`                                | The full catalog document
`<root>/latest[.json]`                                 | The list of "recent" items
`<root>/packages[/a<scope>]/<name>/v/<version>`        | Default (TypeScript) assembly for `[a<scope>/]<name>` at `<version>`
`<root>/packages[/a<scope>]/<name>/v/<version>/<lang>` | Transliterated assembly for `[a<scope>/]<name>` at `<version>` in `<lang>`

That CloudFront distribution may use a different domain from the website. For
example the public instance of Construct Hub hosts these under
`api.constructs.dev`. In cases where a different subdomain is not desirable,
a distinct URL path prefix can be used instead (e.g: `domain.tld/api/`).

#### Front-End

The front-end consists in a simple [React] application hosted in an S3 bucket.
A CloudFront distribution fronts this application, ensuring it is served from
edge locations close to any customer, and binding together the static assets
that compose the application and the data objects maintained by the back-end
pipeline.

1. The landing page asynchronously loads the `catalog.json` object to render the
   "latest" tiles, containing the short-list of packages that changed most
   recently.

1. The search feature asynchronously loads the `catalog.json` object if needed,
   and performs client-side filtering to prepare search results.

1. Package detail pages fetch the relevant `assembly.json` object from the
   package store, and renders the detail page using information contained
   therein.

   - If a different language (than JavaScript) is selected, the
     `package-${lang}.json` object is fetched instead, providing the relevant
     documentation elements. In the event that object is not available yet, a
     message will be displayed instead, instructing the user to try again later.

   URL                                                       | Description
   ----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------
   `<root>/packages[/@<scope>]/<name>`                       | Redirects to the latest known version of `[@scope/]name`
   `<root>/packages[/@<scope>]/<name>/v/<version>`           | The overview of `[@scope/]name` at `version`
   `<root>/packages[/@<scope>]/<name>/v/<version>/docs`      | The documentation (`README.md`) of `[@scope/]name` at `version`
   `<root>/packages[/@<scope>]/<name>/v/<version>/docs/<FQN>`| The documentation for type `FQN` in `[@scope/]name` at `version`

   - When a `<version>` parameter is only a prefix of a SemVer version number,
     the URL redirects to the latest known version in that line (e.g: `/v/1`
     would redirect to `/v/1.2.3`, and `/v/1.1` would redirect to `/v/1.1.9`)
   - A query parameter (e.g: `?lang=go`) may be added to anchor a documentation
     page (under the `/docs` scope) on a particular language. If that parameter
     is not specified, the users' last selected language (or *TypeScript*) will
     be used.

The details of URLs to be configrued in CloudFront is available in [appendix
"CloudFront URLs"](#cloudfront-urls).

#### Backend X Frontend Compatibility

As described earlier, the front-end application consumes artifacts that are stored on the backend. Since these artifacts are subject to change,
we need to define a mechanism by which the front-end is able to detect and operate on various versions of them.

To that end, we propose a generic mechanism to apply to all artifact types:

Every artifact will comply to the [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) specification
and include its major version in the `version` field of the schema:

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  ...
}
```

```json
{
  "version": "v2",
  ...
}
```

Every time a change in the artifact occurs, the contents of the artifact is replaced with the new version.
Since artifacts are created in a long running background process, the new version
may not be available immediately. This in turn means that at any given point in time,
the artifact can either be in its new version, or **any** of its older ones.

As a general guideline, we *prefer displaying an older version of an artifact, than to display nothing at all.*.
To that end, the front-end application will have to support displaying all versions of the artifact.

Specifically, we describe how to implement this for each type of artifact.

##### Package Documentation

Package documentation is created by the **Doc-Gen** function, which produces a JSON definition file:

`packages/${assembly.name}/v${assembly.version}/docs-${lang}.json`

Since the front-end fetches and parses this file, we'd like for it to operate on type safe interfaces that describe the schema.
This will ensure that breaking changes will manifest as compile time errors, and force us to handle them.

To that end, we will extend [`jsii-docgen`](https://github.com/cdklabs/jsii-docgen) to define this schema, and provide an API to produce it.
The version of the schema file will be the version of the package.
Every time a change is made to the schema, we automatically detect what type of change has been made. (i.e breaking or not)

> This can be done by using either [json-schema-diff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-diff), or [jsii-diff](https://github.com/aws/jsii/tree/main/packages/jsii-diff).

If a breaking change is detected, we enforce that the next version to be released will include a major version bump.
(i.e the commit was accompanied with a *BREAKING CHANGE:* notice)

> This can be done by storing the version prior to the bump, and comparing with the one after.

When a new major version of the schema is released, it is automatically picked up and
deployed to the backend. Since the schema is overidden, this will break the front-end
because the version supporting the new schema hasn't been deployed yet.
We cannot afford this, which means we must enforce a deployment order in this scenario,
by which the backend is deployed **only after** the front-end supporting it is deployed.

We can enforce this by employing the following mechanism:

- The front-end declares a `peerDepenedency` on `jsii-docgen`. (e.g `^1.0.0`)
- The backend declares a `devDependency` on `jsii-docgen` (e.g `1.0.0`)

When a new major version of `jsii-docgen` is released (e.g `2.0.0`):

- If the backend picks up this version first, the resolved version in the closure
will be `2.0.0`. This will conflict with the version that the front-end requires,
and thus fail at install time.
- If the front-end picks up this version first, it will be updated and a new version
will be released that depends on `2.0.0`. At this point, when backend dependencies
are upgraded, both `jsii-docgen`, and the front-end itself are upgraded,
which is the desired outcome.

> In addition, so that don't rely on `npm` behavior to reject this change,
we can write a unit test that compares the schema version being used by the front-end,
to the one being used by the backend, they have to match.

This mechanism enforces that when the backend picks up a new version major of the schema,
it will have to pick up a new version of the front-end that supports it.

From this point on, we just need to make sure we deploy the front-end first in the CDK application.

In order for the front-end to support multiple versions of the schema, it will have to:

1. Fetch the schema from `/../docs-{lang}.json`
2. Extract the version field.
3. Based on the version, render the appropriate component.

> The front-end will have to preserve the code for rendering all component versions, but will only have to actively maintain the latest one.

#### Website Analytics

An analytics solutions will be designed to enable monitoring the success and
use-cases of the platform. A stream of URLs hit by users will be collected,
including search terms used by users. That data will be completely anonymous,
and an opaque identifier will be used to enable approximating "unique visitor"
counts, etc. No cross-site tracking will be performed.

If IP addresses are fed into the analyitics service, these will not be
persisted, but may instead be mapped to a coarse-grained location (e.g:
country).

Legal review will be necessary to determine if the dataset implies compliance
requirements for GDPR, CCPA, and similar consumer privacy regulations.

#### Monitoring & Alarming

Private instances of the Construct Hub are managed by their owners/operators.
The Construct Hub provides built-in monitoring and alarming support to
facilitate operating a private instance. This includes the following elements:

- **CloudFront Distribution**:
  - `Sum` of `Requests`: total traffic served by the website
  - `Average` of `TotalErrorRate`: error responses are a bad customer experience
    + Alarm when `> 3%` for `5 minutes`
  - `Average` of `4xxErrorRate`: errors caused by a bad request
    + Alarm when `> 3%` for `5 minutes`
  - `Average` of `5xxErrorRate`: errors caused by a server error
    + Alarm when `> 1%` for `5 minutes`

- **S3 Buckets**:
  - `Maximum` of `BucketSizeBytes`: gives a sense of storage cost
  - `Maximum` of `NumberOfObjects`: gives a sense of storage cost

- **Lambda Functions**:
  - `Sum` of `Invocations`: gives a sense of scale
  - `Sum` of `Errors`: when functions crash during execution, or time out
    + Alarm when `> 1` for `5 minutes`
  - `Sum` of `Throttles`: when functions cannot start due to concurrency limits
    + Alarm when `> 1` for `3 consecutive 5 minutes intervals`
  - `Maximum` of `ConcurrentExecutions` (per-function **and** account-wide):
    gives insight into scaling limits. Alarm indicates a limit increase should
    be requested to AWS Support
    + Alarm when `≥ 80% of account limit` for `6 consecutive 5 minutes intervals`
  - `Maximum`, `p99` and `p90` of `Duration`
    + Alarm when `Maximum` is `≥ 80% of timeout` for
      `3 consecutive 5 minutes intervals`
  - All Lambda functions are paired with a dead-letter queue, such that "poison
    pill" messages are side-lined for investigation
    + Alarm when the queue is non-empty

- **SQS Queues**:
  - `Maximum` of `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage`: gives a sense of whether the
    message processing thoughput is adequate or not (and whether a backlog is
    accumulating)
    + Alarm when `> 3600` for `5 minutes`
  - `Maximum` of `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible`: gives a sense of how
    many messages are currently "in-flight"
  - `Maximum` of `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`: gives a sense of how many
    messages are pending processing

#### Construct Packaging

The Construct Hub is to be created as a reusable construct, including all
necessary components of the application. The public instance of Construct Hub
will simply be an AWS-Managed instance of that, which feeds from packages
published to the [npm registry](https://npmjs.com).

It will expose a simple API: a `ConstructHub` class will be the main entry point
to the application, with the following configuration properties:

Name           | Description
---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`hostedZone`   | The Route53 Hosted Zone to use for hosting the Construct Hub instance
`pathPrefix`   | The URL prefix for the Construct Hub hosting
`contactUrls`  | An object describing the URLs to use for contacting operators (e.g: GitHub issue templates)
`enableNpmFeed`| Whether the NPM registry integration should be enabled (optional, defaults to enabled)
`updatesTopic` | An SNS topic where new package notifications will be sent (optional, defaults to none)

It exposes the following attributes, to allow integrations to operate correctly:

Name                | Description
--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`ingestionQueueUrl` | The URL of the SQS queue where ingestion messages should be sent
`ingestionRoleArn`  | The IAM role used to process input payloads (and read S3 staged objects)
`ingestionDlqArn`   | The ARN of the ingestion pipeline's dead letter queue

#### Monitoring & Operations

The `ConstructHub` construct will provision a CloudWatch dashboard and a set
of alarms to help have an overview of the system's operational health. As much
as possible those monitoring characteristics should be encoded in the form of
common patterns that can be applied in other contexts than the Construct Hub.

All alarms are exposed out of the construct, such that operators are able to
configure customized actions to react to metrics going out-of-band, including
integrations with external (sometimes private) notification software (such as
Pager Duty, etc...).

#### Cost of Operation

In order for organizations to confidently deploy their own instance of the
Construct Hub, they will need to be provided with an estimated cost of operation
for the website, that includes:

- Infrastructure cost
- Operations cost (monitoring, operator hours, ...)

High-level estiamtes will be provided based on our experience from hosting the
public instance of Construct Hub, and will be assessed in relation to the number
of packages ingested, etc...

### Are there any open issues that need to be addressed later?

- When the catalog becomes too large to be convenient to process in-memory on
  the client-side, it may need to be sharded, or the search feature may need to
  be re-done as a dynamic back-end service. A prototype shows that 409 packages
  amount to about `913,86 KiB` of un-compressed JSON-encoded data, which reduces
  to `71.53 KiB` when compressed using the `gzip` algorithm. This means each
  package would consume about `2.23 KiB` of un-compressed data, and results in
  an additional `0.17 KiB` to effectively transfer.

- Generation of per-language documentation may become prohibitively expensive,
  and it may be interesting to only generate language-specific documentation
  once a customer has expressed interest in it.

- Generated documentation will eventually benefit from cross-linking API
  elements across indexed libraries. All the necessary information is present
  (the `assembly.json` object includes a `dependencies` section).

### CloudFront URLs

There are two buckets backing the CloudFront distribution that serves the
Construct Hub:

1. The React application bucket, which we will refer to as `react-bucket` in
   this document,
1. The packages information bucket, which we will refer to as `packages-bucket`
   in this document.

As the application is entirely static, all URLs described in this document only
support the `HEAD`, `GET`, and possibly `OPTIONS` HTTP verbs. All URLs are to be
prefixed with the configured `pathPrefix` value, if one was provided.

URL                 | Description                                                 | Source
--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------
`/`                 | The React application's entry point (`index.html`)          | `react-bucket`
`/assets/*`         | Assets that are part of the React application (CSS, JS, ...)| `react-bucket`
`/data/*`           | The data files maintained by the back-end application       | `packages-bucket`

### API Contracts

#### "Package Discovery" Function

The *package discovery* function receives no particular input. It is triggered
by a recurring trigger, external event source (such as a webhook, etc...), and
should be built specifically to bridge this input event to the relevant output
format.

The result of the *package discovery* function is pumping discovered packages
through an SNS topic. Each notification's schema corresponds to the *Ingestion*
function's input.

#### "Ingestion" Function

The input to the *Ingestion* function is a JSON object corresponding to the
following TypeScript interface:

```ts
import { Assembly } from '@jsii/spec';

export interface IngestionInput {
  /**
   * A unique identifier for the origin that notified about this package

The *Ingestion* function produces no output, but creates the `assembly.json`
object, which has the following schema:

```ts
import { Assembly } from '@jsii/spec';

export interface IndexedPackage {
  /**
   * The name of the package.
   */
  readonly name: string;

  /**
   * The version of the package.
   */
  readonly version: string;

  /**
   * The `.jsii` assembly for the package.
   */
  readonly assembly: Assembly;

  /**
   * The timestamp at which the package version was created.
   */
  readonly createdAt: Date;

  /**
   * Metadata associated by the discovery function to the package.
   */
  readonly metadata?: { readonly [key: string]: string };

  // This interface may be extended with additional fields in the future.
}
```

#### "Doc-Gen" Function

The *Doc-Gen* function is triggered from S3 object update events.

It produces no particular output, but creates or updates the relevant object
in the S3 Bucket that contains transliterated package information:

```ts
import { Assembly } from '@jsii/spec';

export type TransliteratedAssembly = Assembly;
```

#### "Catalog Builder" Function

The *Catalog Builder* function is triggered from S3 object update stream events.

It produces no particular output, but creates or updates the `catalog.json`
object in the S3 Bucket that contains the full package list:

```ts
export interface Catalog {
  /**
   * All packages tracked in this catalog object.
   */
  readonly packages: readonly PackageInfo[];

  /**
   * The timestamp of the latest update to this object. When the object is in
   * JSON form, this is encoded as an ISO-8601 timestamp, preferrably using the
   * UTC time zone.
   */
  readonly updatedAt: Date;
}

export interface PackageInfo {
  /**
   * The name of the assembly.
   */
  readonly name: string;

  /**
   * The major version of this assembly, according to SemVer.
   */
  readonly majorVersion: number;

  /**
   * The complete SemVer version string for this package's major version stream,
   * including pre-release identifiers, but excluding additional metadata
   * (everything starting at `+`, if there is any).
   */
  readonly version: string;

  /**
   * The SPDX license identifier for the package's license.
   */
  readonly license: string;

  /**
   * The list of keywords configured on the package.
   */
  readonly keywords: readonly string[];

  /**
   * Metadata assigned by the discovery function to the latest release of this
   * package's major version stream, if any.
   */
  readonly metadata?: { readonly [key: string]: string };

  /**
   * The author of the package.
   */
  readonly author: {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly email?: string;
    readonly url?: string;
  };

  /**
   * The list of languages configured on the package, and the corresponding
   * configuration.
   */
  readonly languages: AssemblyTargets;

  /**
   * The timestamp at which this version was created.
   */
  readonly time: Date;

  /**
   * The description of the package.
   */
  readonly description?: string;
}
```
