# AWS CloudWatch Application Signals L2 Construct for Simplifying SLO

* **Original Author(s):**: @liunia-amazon
* **Tracking Issue**: [#673](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/issues/673)
* **API Bar Raiser**: @moelasmar

The `ServiceLevelObjective` module is a collection of L2 constructs which leverages native L1 CFN resources, simplifying the
Application Signals Service Level Objectives (SLOs) creation process to monitor the reliability of a service against customer expectations.
The current process of creating SLOs using AWS CDK is complex and requires significant input from users, leading to potential errors and
a time-consuming setup process. This design document addresses these challenges by proposing a predefined constants, and robust set of L2 CDK
constructs that simplify the creation of SLOs while providing the flexibility.

## Working Backwards

### CHANGELOG

`feat(applicationSignals): introduce new Application Signals L2 constructs for simplifying SLO creation and management`

### README

Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals Service Level Objectives (SLOs) L2 construct
enables customers to create and manage Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for their applications
using Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals. SLOs help ensure critical business
operations meet customer expectations by setting and tracking specific reliability and availability targets.

The ServiceLevelObjective construct provides two types of SLOs:<br>
Period-based SLOs: Evaluate performance against goals using defined time periods.<br>
Request-based SLOs: Measure performance based on request success ratios

#### Key Features

1. Easy creation of both period-based and request-based SLOs.
2. Support for custom CloudWatch metrics and math expressions.
3. Automatic error budget calculation and tracking.

### Usage

#### Use Case 1 - Create a Period-based SLO with custom metrics, default attainmentGoal: 99.9 and warningThreshold: 30

```
const periodSlo = ServiceLevelObjective.periodBased(this, 'PeriodSLO', {
  name: 'my-period-slo',
  goal: {
    interval: Interval.rolling({
      duration: 7,
      unit: DurationUnit.DAY,
    }),
  },
  metric: {
    metricThreshold: 100,
    periodSeconds: 300,
    statistic: 'Average',
    metricDataQueries: [/* ... */],
  },
});
```

#### Use Case 2 - Create a Period-based SLO with service/operation, attainmentGoal is 99.99 and warningThreshold is 50

```
const availabilitySlo = ServiceLevelObjective.periodBased(this, 'ApiAvailabilitySlo', {
  name: 'api-availability-slo',
  description: 'API endpoint availability SLO',
  goal: {
    attainmentGoal: 99.99,
    warningThreshold: 50,
    interval: Interval.calendar({
      duration: 1,
      unit: DurationUnit.MONTH,
      // default startTime is now,
    }),
  },
  metric: {
    metricThreshold: 99,
    metricType: MetricType.AVAILABILITY,
    operationName: 'OrderProcessing',
    keyAttributes: KeyAttributes.service({
     name: 'MyService',
     environment: 'Development',
   });
    periodSeconds: 300,
    statistic: 'Average',
  },
});
```

#### Use Case 3 - Create request based SLO with custom metrics

```
const requestSlo = ServiceLevelObjective.requestBased(this, 'RequestSLO', {
  name: 'my-request-slo',
  goal: {
    interval: Interval.calendar({
      duration: 30,
      unit: DurationUnit.DAY,
      startTime: 1,
    }),
  },
  metric: {
    metricThreshold: 200,
    goodCountMetrics: [/* ... */],
    totalCountMetrics: [/* ... */],
  },
});
```

### Important Considerations

1. SLO type (period-based or request-based) cannot be changed after creation
2. Application Signals service operations must report standard metrics before SLO creation

### Best Practices

1. Use period-based SLOs for time-based measurements (e.g., latency)
2. Use request-based SLOs for counting-based measurements (e.g., availability)
3. Set appropriate warning thresholds below attainment goals
4. Configure burn rate windows for early detection of issues

### API Design

This L2 construct simplifies SLO creation while maintaining the
flexibility needed for various use cases. It handles the complexity of
creating and managing SLOs, allowing focus on defining the service reliability targets.

### What is the technical solution (design) of this feature?

#### 1.  Simplified API Structure

Added pre-defined defaults and builder patterns for cleaner code organization
